# GoForms

## What is this?
GoForms is a GUI programming framework designed for use with the Go language.
It provides similar functionality to WinForms.

- It simplifies window message handling.
- It includes object-oriented wrappers for common controls.
- It features a layout system.
- It includes a drawing package based on the gdiplus technology.

## Features

- **Lightweight Functions:** UI functions are designed as simple wrappers
  over the native parts of the system.
- **Lightweight Objects:** UI objects do not maintain unnecessary state data, 
  as long as they are maintained in the underlying native objects.
- **Easy to use API:** Carefully designed API to help calling them in Go smooth and concise.   
- **Easy to extend:** Coded in object-oriented style, allowing for inheritance and overriding of components.
  > While OOP may not be widely embraced, particularly within the Go community, 
  > I think it offers a suitable approach for this framework.
